answer to question 1
#to calucate the compound interest
pri = 10000# principal amount 
compfr = 12#compound frequncy
roi = 0.08#rate of interest
time = input("for how much time u want to find the compound interest on principal ?")
time = float(time)
A = pri*((1+roi/compfr)**(time*compfr))
A = float(A)
print (A)

ANSWER TO QUESTION 2

# TO Calculate theare of the rectangle 
height = input("enter the value of height?")
width = input ("enter the value of width?")
height = float(height)
width = float(width)
area = height*width# find the area of the rectangle
if area <=50: 
	print ("the area of rectangle ",area,"that area is sooooooooo small") 
elif area >=50 and area<=200:
	print ("the area of rectangle",area,"that area is ooook")
else:
	print ("the area of rectangle",area,"OMG")
